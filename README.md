# Sphere Reflexion

By projecting an image of the surroundings onto a sphere, I create a mirror-like material using three.js which is the JavaScript 3D library for WebGL.

## Movement controls
- For cube zoom in/out and rotation use mouse
- For sphere use the following keys combinations
    - Arrow keys/WASD: Translate
    - QA:  Rotate Right/Left
    - ED:  Rotate Left/Right
    - RW: Rotate Up/Down
    - FS: Rotate Down/Up
    - Z: Reset position and rotation.
